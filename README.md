# Hullabalook Technical Challenge
## Overview
Part of Hullabalook's interview process. To be done in 5 hours, while using Vue.js.
Hullabalook asked me to focus on areas that interest me the most. Whether it's the design, the interactivity, the data or a bit of everything.
I focused on styling the web after the given example image, while adding some visual feedback and functions to the game.
I felt functionalities was limited by my inexperience with Vue.js.

With myself having no prior experience with Vue.js before, this was a good learning experience.

## To Use
The goal of the game is to match 4 products with their correct brand.

Click on the product image to select it, this will also automatically starts the timer.

Then click on the matching brand image below.

Getting a match and there will be check mark along with the correct brand displayed on the product image.

## Challenges
Learning and trying to use Vue.js for this was a challenge. I can see similarities to React, however I have yet to gain good understanding of Vue.js syntax. This resulted in suboptimal code that I noticed, but did not have time to look into better implementation.

## Future Improvements
* Have some kind of game ends message when user gets 4 matches.
* Prevent adding to the score when clicking the same product/brand matching multiple times
* Add tabs for other products, to be similar to the given example image.
* Learn more about Vue.js and implement better codes.
